### What is this repository for? ###
Interviewing people!

### How do I get set up? ###

Run the RestApi solution from Visual Studio or VS Code and visit http://localhost:56498/swagger/index.html to use the debugger/page.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Write some endpoints for CRUD methods so that we can add people to a fake database and get back an org chart of users and their relationships to managers.
Note that our FakeDatabase is not writing to disk, but to memory, so any Post/Put/Patch method data should be saved so that we can see your work.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
